# Quick Text

This is a WIP. But the general idea is this.

Through out the day, I need to write up longer articles of text. Some are repsonses and some are simply updates that I need to use somewhere like Slack, Facebook, Stack Overflow, etc...

When I use the supplied text area for these services with anything longer than a paragaph, I end up with typos and other errors. Even worse is I end up publishing the text before I'm done.

This application fixes this for me. Here is the flow.

1. Visit url
2. Start entering some text that you need to use else where.
3. At some interval, this text is saved into local storage
4. When you're done, copy to clipboard
5. Not sure if it should save it after you're done or delete the entry
